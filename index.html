            <h1> Hi </h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> I have an older sister and I have a mom and dad.
                I was born in Arizona on December 30, 2010. I currently live in Texas.
                Like I said I am in 5th grade and I am 11 years old.
                I like to paint and draw. My favorite hobby is playing soccer and painting like I said.
                I like the color blue and I love going to the beach.
                My dream place to travel is Hawaii but I have never been there.
            I like to read mystery books and I live writing and math mostly.
